This Python code is really good:

    def good():
        a = 1
        b = 2
        c = a + b
        return None

This one is *even better:*

    def better():
        a = 128
        b = 256
        c = a * b
        return None

Stripping `AUTO_INCREMENT=xx` in sql dumps:

    sed -e 's/AUTO_INCREMENT=[0-9]* //g' -i mysql_project_db.sql
